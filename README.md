## Introduction

The Note Taker is an Express.js application designed for small business owners who need to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks by writing and saving notes. This application features a user-friendly interface where users can create, view, and delete notes seamlessly. The backend is powered by Express.js, and note data is stored and retrieved from a JSON file.
